# FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs Certification Projects

This repository contains the five required projects for the FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs Certification:

1. **Timestamp Microservice:**

   - Converts Unix timestamps (integers) to readable dates and vice-versa.
   - Demonstrates basic Node.js, Express, and data handling.

2. **Request Header Parser Microservice:**

   - Extracts and returns the IP address and language of the user making the request.
   - Focuses on accessing request headers and parsing information.

3. **URL Shortener Microservice:**

   - Creates short, unique URLs for long, complex ones.
   - Explores URL manipulation, data storage (likely using a database), and API design.

4. **Exercise Tracker:**

   - Allows users to log exercise data (type, description, duration, date).
   - Involves data validation, and potentially a more robust database schema.

5. **File Metadata Microservice:**
   - Analyzes uploaded files and returns metadata such as name, type, and size.

**Technologies Used:**

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (or other suitable database)
